<h1>Welcome to my Rock / Paper / Scissors game</h1>
<p>This game was made in html / css / javascript / bootstrap 4</p>
<p>All you have to do is to make your choice (rock, paper or scissors) and see if you were lucky enough to beat the computer!</p>
<p>At the top there is a scoreboard that tells you where are you at in terms of points, and at the same time, your opponent's score.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed it!</p>
